# Opensea-tests-APIs
Testing Opeansea's APIs in order to track new events from specific Tokens/NFTs

## About The Project
The goal of the project was to use Opensea's API in order to find and alert the user of any new events regarding the token/NFT they wanted to track.
Data from any token can be obtainable if both the token_id and the asset_contract_address are known/given.
The project is yet missing the connexion between the Front-end and the API requests to make it dynamic.
